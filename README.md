# A bio about the creator
## This git repository was created for practice.

Hi, my name is UGI. 
I'm interested in deep learning and protein structures.
I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my code and give me some feedback.




# Purpose of deep learning models
It was created to predict the features of the original complex structure from the features of the point mutated complex structure.




## Data collection
The data was created by predicting the structure with alphafold by performing point mutations on the interresidue.
